<h1 style="color:blue;"> Hello! </h1>

<h2> My name is Aidan Rafferty </h2>

<p>

I am from Greenwich, CT and grew up just outside New York City. I spent many a weekends going to concerts in the city but have called Boulder my home for 5 years now. I love technology but my passion is space and human spaceflight. My goal is to fuse these two passions and pioneer the future of commerical and civil space travel. I love being outdoors, I have been skiing for the past 20 years and I have my class B skydiving license. I am very excited about this class and have gotten most of my web experience here at CU and specifically in TAM. I took web with Ian and became hooked on web development and especially JavaScript. I have some Unix and experience in other languages such as C++, MATLAB, and Python. I'm a quick learner. I am particulary excited to learn about Parallax scrolling and wordpress. Overall every topic sounds really awesome to me and I'm excited about this class.
